- Rank top 3 Breweries which produce the strongest beers?
- Which year did beers enjoy the highest ratings?
- Based on the userâ€™s ratings which factors are important among taste, aroma,   appearance, and palette?
- If you were to recommend 3 beers to your friends based on this data which ones will you recommend?
- Which Beer style seems to be the favorite based on reviews written by users?
- How does written review compare to overall review score for the beer styles?
- How do find similar beer drinkers by using written reviews only?
